## Details

PlotPyStack is a Python-Qt visualization and scientific GUI stack based on PythonQwt, guidata and plotpy.

PlotPyStack is composed of the following packages:

* [PythonQwt](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PythonQwt): Python wrapper for the Qwt C++ class library which extends the Qt framework with widgets for scientific and engineering applications. It provides a widget to plot 2-dimensional data and various widgets to display and control bounded or unbounded floating point values.

* [guidata](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/guidata): Automatic graphical user interfaces generation for easy dataset editing and display. It also provides helpers and application development tools for Python-Qt.

* [guiqwt](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/guiqwt): Efficient 2D data-plotting features (curve/image visualization and related tools) for interactive computing and signal/image processing application development using PythonQwt. Note: ``guiqwt`` is now deprecated and will soon be replaced by ``plotpy``.

* [plotpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plotpy): Based on PythonQwt and on the scientific modules NumPy and SciPy, ``plotpy`` is a Python library providing efficient 2D data-plotting features (curve/image visualization and related tools) for interactive computing and signal/image processing application development.
